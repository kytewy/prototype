# Phase 5: Cytoscape.js Graph Visualization

## Description
Implementation of interactive graph visualization for document relationships.

## Prerequisites
- [ ] Phase 4 completed successfully
- [ ] Hybrid database queries working
- [ ] Graph analysis operational

## Steps

### 5.1 Graph Visualization Foundation
```markdown
1. Install Cytoscape.js and extensions
2. Create graph data transformation service
3. Design node and edge styling system
4. Implement basic force-directed layout
5. Add graph container and basic controls
```

### 5.2 Interactive Graph Features
```markdown
1. Implement node selection and highlighting
2. Create relationship filtering controls
3. Add zoom, pan, and fit controls
4. Implement search highlighting
5. Create node details sidebar/modal
6. Add graph export functionality
```

### 5.3 Advanced Graph Styling & Layouts
```markdown
1. Style nodes by document type and region
2. Style edges by relationship type and strength
3. Implement multiple layout algorithms:
   - Force-directed (default)
   - Hierarchical
   - Circular
4. Add layout switching controls
5. Optimize performance for 1,000+ nodes
```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Interactive graph visualizes 1,000+ document relationships
- [ ] Graph integrates with search results
- [ ] Multiple layouts and filtering options work
- [ ] Graph performance is smooth (30+ FPS)
