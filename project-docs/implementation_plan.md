# Implementation Plan

> **Note:** This is a high-level overview. For detailed tasks and implementation steps, refer to the corresponding workflow files in `.windsurf/workflows/`.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation
**Reference:** `@[phase1-foundation.md]`

**Key Milestones:**
- Project structure and environment setup
- FastAPI foundation with middleware, health checks, and error handling
- Testing framework configuration
- LangFuse integration

**Status:** In progress

### Phase 2: Document Operations
**Reference:** `@[phase2-document-ops.md]`

**Key Milestones:**
- PostgreSQL/pgvector document management
  - Document models, embeddings, and vector search
- Neo4j graph foundation
  - Document nodes, relationships, and graph queries
- Basic React interface
  - Document upload, listing, and search components

**Status:** TBD

### Phase 3: LLM Integration
**Reference:** `@[phase3-llm-integration.md]`

**Key Milestones:**
- LLM service integration
- Relationship extraction
- Entity recognition
- Confidence scoring

**Status:** TBD

### Phase 4: Database Integration
**Reference:** `@[phase4-db-integration.md]`

**Key Milestones:**
- Hybrid query engine
- Advanced search capabilities
- Database synchronization

**Status:** TBD

### Phase 5: Visualization
**Reference:** `@[phase5-visualization.md]`

**Key Milestones:**
- Cytoscape.js integration
- Interactive graph visualization
- Relationship filtering and highlighting

**Status:** TBD

### Phase 6: Testing & Polish
**Reference:** `@[phase6-testing-polish.md]`

**Key Milestones:**
- Comprehensive testing
- Performance optimization
- Security hardening
- Documentation completion

**Status:** TBD

## Testing Strategy
**Reference:** `@[testing-audit.md]`

Testing audit will be performed after each sub-phase completion.

## Workflow Integration

### Task-Based Workflows
**References:**
- `@[new-feature.md]` - Feature development process
- `@[bug-fix.md]` - Issue resolution process
- `@[code-review.md]` - Code quality verification

## Next Steps

1. Complete Phase 1 Foundation
2. Run testing audit using `@[testing-audit.md]`
3. Begin Phase 2 Document Operations

## Development Process

### Workflow Integration
- Each phase follows the workflows defined in `.windsurf/workflows/`
- Testing audit is performed after each sub-phase
- Task-based workflows are used as needed throughout development

### Documentation
- Project documentation will be updated as development progresses
- Technical decisions will be documented in project-docs
- API documentation will be maintained through FastAPI's built-in Swagger UI

## Maintenance & Iteration

- Regular testing audits will be conducted throughout development
- Performance monitoring will be implemented in later phases
- User feedback will be incorporated through iterative development
- Documentation will be updated as features are implemented

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Database Performance:** Monitor query performance, implement indexing
- **API Rate Limits:** Implement caching and request optimization
- **Security Vulnerabilities:** Regular security audits and updates

### Timeline Risks
- **Scope Creep:** Stick to MVP features, defer nice-to-haves
- **Technical Debt:** Allocate time for refactoring in each phase
- **External Dependencies:** Have fallback plans for third-party services

## Success Criteria

### Phase Completion Criteria
- All checklist items completed
- Tests passing with target coverage
- Performance metrics within acceptable ranges
- Code review and approval from team

### Launch Readiness Criteria
- Core user workflows fully functional
- Security review completed
- Performance testing passed
- Documentation complete
- Monitoring and error tracking active
