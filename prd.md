# AI Legislation Tracking System - Product Requirements Document

## Project Overview

**What we're building:** An intelligent system that automatically ingests, tracks, analyzes, and provides searchable access to AI-related legislation and regulatory documentation worldwide.

**Problem Statement:** Organizations struggle to navigate the rapidly evolving landscape of AI regulations across different jurisdictions. There's no centralized system that can automatically track changes, provide citations, and answer complex multi-jurisdictional queries about AI legislation.

**Value Proposition:** Enable organizations to stay compliant and informed about AI regulations through automated monitoring, intelligent analysis, and natural language querying capabilities.

## Target Users

- **Primary:** Legal teams at AI/tech companies
- **Secondary:** Compliance officers, policy researchers, government affairs teams
- **Use Cases:**
  - "Where can we deploy our AI product across different regions?"
  - "What's the difference between EU and Canada AI regulation?"
  - "Has there been any changes to AI legislation in the past month?"
  - "Show me all privacy-related AI regulations with citations"

## Core Features & User Flows

### 1. Automated Legislation Ingestion

- **Flow:** System continuously monitors government websites, legal databases, and regulatory sources
- **Process:** Document ingestion → Change detection → Metadata extraction → Storage
- **Output:** Structured legislation database with change tracking

### 2. Intelligent Search & Retrieval

- **Flow:** User enters natural language query → Multi-agent processing → Structured response with citations
- **Capabilities:**
  - Multi-hop queries ("Compare X regulation across Y jurisdictions")
  - Citation-backed answers
  - Regional/topic filtering

### 3. Knowledge Graph Visualization

- **Flow:** User opens graph view → Interactive network of legislation and relationships → Click nodes for details
- **Features:**
  - Visual representation of primary laws, secondary regulations, interpretations, and case law
  - Color-coded by document type, jurisdiction-coded by region
  - Interactive relationships ("interprets", "amends", "references", "conflicts with")
  - Advanced graph algorithms (centrality analysis, community detection, path-finding)
  - Filtering by region, topic, document type, and relationship strength
  - Node details panel with summaries and related documents
  - Export capabilities for regulatory impact analysis

### 4. Change Detection & Alerts

- **Flow:** New/updated legislation detected → Quality assurance → Notification → Database update
- **Features:** Version tracking, change summaries, impact analysis

### 5. Multi-Agent Analysis Pipeline

- **Agents:**
  - **Document Ingestion Agent:** Document collection and preprocessing
  - **Metadata Extraction Agent:** Region, topic, document type classification
  - **Relationship Extraction Agent:** LLM-powered analysis of document connections
  - **Quality Assurance Agent:** Content validation and confidence scoring
  - **Graph Analysis Agent:** Network analysis using Neo4j algorithms
  - **Query Processing Agent:** Natural language query handling with citations

## Technical Architecture

### Backend Stack

- **Framework:** FastAPI (Python)
- **Graph Database:** Neo4j Community Edition (relationships & graph queries)
- **Vector Database:** LanceDB (document content & semantic search)
- **LLM Provider:** OpenAI-compatible API
- **Observability:** LangFuse

### Frontend Stack

- **Framework:** React
- **Graph Visualization:** Cytoscape.js (network analysis & interactive graphs)
- **Purpose:** Production-ready interface with sophisticated graph capabilities

### Data Architecture

- **Hybrid Database Approach:**
  - LanceDB: Full document content, embeddings, semantic search
  - Neo4j: Document metadata, relationships, graph algorithms
- **Primary Sources:** Official government legislation, regulatory documents
- **Secondary Sources:** Legal interpretations, analysis, commentary
- **Relationship Types:** interprets, amends, references, conflicts_with, implements, supersedes

## In-Scope for MVP

- Export functionality for analysis and reporting

## Out-of-Scope for MVP

❌ Real-time web scraping of government sites
❌ Advanced alerting/notification system  
❌ User authentication and permissions
❌ Advanced graph analytics dashboard
❌ Real-time collaborative editing
❌ Mobile application
❌ Integration with legal databases

## Success Metrics

- **Technical:** System can ingest and process 1,000+ documents with full relationship mapping
- **Functional:** Accurately answers 90% of test queries with proper citations and relationship context
- **Graph Performance:** Visualizes networks of 1,000+ nodes with sub-second response times
- **User Experience:** Demo generates positive feedback with interactive graph exploration
- **Query Performance:** Hybrid search response time under 5 seconds

## Technical Constraints & Guardrails

- **Graph Database Limits:** Neo4j Community Edition supports unlimited nodes/relationships
- **LLM Usage Control:** Implement response length limits and structured output formats
- **Relationship Quality:** Mandatory confidence scoring (>0.7) for relationship storage
- **Citation Requirements:** All responses must include source citations with graph paths
- **Performance Targets:** Graph visualization must handle 1,000+ nodes at 30+ FPS
- **Cost Management:** Token usage monitoring with relationship extraction optimization

## Risk Mitigation

- **Data Quality:** Multi-stage validation pipeline
- **Legal Accuracy:** Clear disclaimers about AI-generated content
- **Scalability:** Ray framework for distributed processing
- **Observability:** Comprehensive logging with LangFuse
